## Export Call Recordings from Webex Contact Center

### Executing Capture API calls using Spring Boot

This is a sample web application to export call recordings from WebexCC using the Capture API. It uses a simple Spring Boot web application to serve a web page for date selectable call recoding extraction. The call recordings can be persisted to localhost, AWS, or Google.

The application can be modified, enhanced or extended to fit the use cases required.

Watch the demo below to understand what this application does and how to set it up and extend on it.

> **Note:** This is a sample that assumes you know the basics of rest API calls as well as Java/Spring Boot.

> This demo goes over the Java sample code that is used to extract call recordings from Webex Contact Center with the Capture API. The code exports the call recordings from Webex Contact Center and provides interfaces to persist the recordings to different platforms. It leverages the power of Spring Boot to make this consumable by any external use or storage.

> These samples are meant to be used, as "samples", for demos, and to understand how to interact with the WebexCC APIs.
> When building a production grade solution, please consider the overall architecture and design with a security first approach.
> Also, please consider how you would extend this app for multiple orgs, manage tokens for the orgs, etc.
> These samples are only meant to provide working, starter code and many layers have been simplified and abstracted away to focus on the Webex Contact Center use cases.
