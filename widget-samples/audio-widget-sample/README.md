## Audio Widget Sample

In this tutorial we leverage native javascript for access to the PC microphone and give ourselves the ability to record a wav file, and convert it to a play on an IVR platform. From there, within this simple app, we fetch all our wav files on our tenant and have the ability to replace.update any of our files.

## Developer Documentation

## Getting Started

The sample can be hosted locally and the demo covers how this is done by building and hosting the widget on localhost.

> To understand how to interact with our Desktop Layout, please watch the video and supplemental detailed documentation @ **[Desktop Layout - Administration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/webexcc/SetupandAdministrationGuide_2/b_mp-release-2/b_cc-release-2_chapter_011.html#topic_8230815F4023699032326F948C3F1495)**

### Executing the sample

**Step 1:**

_To use this widget sample on your localhost : _

- Inside this project on your terminal type: `npm install`
- Then inside this project on your terminal type: `npm run dev`
- This should run the app on your localhost:3000

**Step 2:**

_To wire up the Widget to the Layout:_

- Upload the **_audio-widget.json_** file onto your Administration Portal **[WebexCC Portal - US](https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal/home.html#)**
  - _link above is referencing the US portal link please change if you are in different geo (us1, eu1, eu2, anz1)_
  - Note that Layouts are configured per Agent Team.
- Log in to your agent and select the right Team to view the new layout.

**Additional Improvements:**

- You can modify the widget as required.
- To create a new compiled JS file, using `npm run build` which will create the new compiled JS under `build/bundle.js`.
- You may rename this file, host it on your server of choice, and use this as the widget `src` parameter (under navigation >> page >> widgets) in the layout.
